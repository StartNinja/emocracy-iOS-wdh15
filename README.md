##Project: Emocracy
**Elevator Pitch:**
Where to eat for lunch, and who's coming, in 15 seconds.

**Problem:**  You just want a democratic decision on everyday human interactions
Teeing up any kind of social grathering is too slow.
Sending emails, lengthy IM discussions, too much noise.

**Example:** It's 12 o'clock in the office and you want to eat. So you send a few IM's. Get up from your desk and go pester some people to ask if they want to eat. People ask questions like, whats Fred doing? Tell him were going to Bobs Burgers.
This is too slow and too annoying for everyone.

**The Solution:**  Easily Call a Vote, with a Binary Descision
No need for words, just Emoticons
Group members receive notifications, which they can immediately act on, with phone and wearable on BOTH platforms.
Users are notified of the Emocratic result.
 
**What we Built:** Mobile App for iOS & Android
AndroidWear and Apple Watch supported
Call a Vote on a list of Topics
Vote via Android Wear or Apple Watch
Server Side DB and API
Cool Graphics and Sound FX

**Type of the project:** Wearable / Mobile App

**MVP:** Call a Vote. Users get notifications of available Vote. Ability to vote for or against topics from the App or your Wrist! Emocracy is decided and all users are notified of the results all within 1 minute.

**Target Group:** This product is for everybody. In the office, share houses, family, friends, even as a couple.

**Use Case:** How will users typically use this product?
Users load the app, and choose a topic to start a vote on. Their friends and colleagues get the notification and respond with a binary answer. Votes are tallied and the result is pushed to everyone. Effective, Easy, Enjoyable!

**Challenges & Solutions:** What was the most difficult part of the project? What problems did you encounter? How did you solve them?

Trouble with iOS Notifications. Help from Marco (Developer).
Setting up a Push notification server wasnt possible. We faked this by doing polling.
Cant distribute iOS version without enterprise certificate. Android version available.
We didnt have time to run a server in the cloud. So we ran it locally only.
We wanted to add lots of features but had a lack of time. We cut it down to the basic functionality.

**Scalability:** How can the project be further developed?

- GeoLocation or Social Graph based Channels
- User Defined Channel Names “Wanna BBQ on Sat?”
- Shareable Widget, to Vote on ANY Content e.g. Images, Links, Maps, Restaurants, Events, Music?
- Different Polls, like avg. Steps or Heart Rate
- Custom Emoticons
- More Platforms
- Monetize through in App Purchases
- Include Near by Offers (Food / Drink), let users Emote!
