##Project: Emocracy
**Elevator pitch:**  

**Problem:  You just want a democratic decision on everyday human interactions
Teeing up any kind of social grathering is too slow.
Sending emails, lengthy IM discussions, too much noise.

** The Solution:  Easily Call a Vote, with a Binary Descision
No need for words, just Emoticons
Group members receive notifications, which they can immediately act on, with phone and wearable on BOTH platforms.
Users are notified of the Emocratic result
 
** What we Built: Mobile App for iOS & Android
AndroidWear and Apple Watch supported
Call a Vote on a list of Topics
Vote via Android Wear or Apple Watch
Server Side DB and API
Cool Graphics and Sound FX
